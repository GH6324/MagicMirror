> On Apple M1 chips, face swapping takes about 3-5 seconds, varying with your computer's specs and image size.

When processing is complete, a new image will appear in the original location with `_output` added to its filename.

You can continue swapping faces with new photos, or use the top-right menu to flip the mirror and change the face image.
