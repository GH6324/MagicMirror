For Windows users, you need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable to run MagicMirror. Download it here: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

## Download Models

When you first launch the app, it will automatically download the required model files.

If the download progress is stuck at 0% or stops midway, follow these steps for manual setup:

**Download Model Files**

Choose the model file that matches your operating system:

- [server_windows_x86_64.zip](https://github.com/idootop/MagicMirror/releases/download/server-v1.0.0/server_windows_x86_64.zip)
- [server_macos_x86_64.zip](https://github.com/idootop/MagicMirror/releases/download/server-v1.0.0/server_macos_x86_64.zip)

**Extract the Downloaded File**

You'll get a folderâ€”rename it to `MagicMirror`. Move this folder to your computer's `HOME` directory, for example:

Restart MagicMirror, and it should now work properly.
