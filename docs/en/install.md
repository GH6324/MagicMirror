If the download progress is stuck at 0% or stops midway, follow these steps for manual setup:

**Download Model Files**

Choose the model file that matches your operating system:

- [server_windows_x86_64.zip](https://github.com/idootop/MagicMirror/releases/download/server-v1.0.0/server_windows_x86_64.zip)（Windows, most common）
- [server_windows_aarch64.zip](https://github.com/idootop/MagicMirror/releases/download/server-v1.0.0/server_windows_aarch64.zip)（Windows, for ARM64 devices）
- [server_macos_aarch64.zip](https://github.com/idootop/MagicMirror/releases/download/server-v1.0.0/server_macos_aarch64.zip)（macOS, Apple Silicon, such as M1, M4 chips）
- [server_macos_x86_64.zip](https://github.com/idootop/MagicMirror/releases/download/server-v1.0.0/server_macos_x86_64.zip)（macOS, Intel chips）

**Extract the Downloaded File**

You'll get a folder—rename it to `MagicMirror`. Move this folder to your computer's `HOME` directory, for example:

Restart MagicMirror, and it should now work properly.
