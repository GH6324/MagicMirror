## Motivation

![](./docs/assets/demo.webp)

Ever found yourself endlessly scrolling through hairstyles and outfits, wondering "How would this look on me?" As someone who loves exploring different styles but hates the hassle, I dreamed of an app that could instantly show me wearing any look I fancy.

While AI technology has advanced tremendously, most AI face applications either require complex setup, demand high-end GPU hardware, or rely on cloud processing that compromises privacy.

**The ideal solution should be as simple as taking a selfie** - just drag, drop, and transform. No technical expertise needed, no expensive hardware required, and no privacy concerns.

So, why not build one myself?

And that‚Äôs how MagicMirror came to life ‚ú®

Enjoy! ;)
