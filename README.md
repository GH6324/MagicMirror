## Motivation

![](screenshots/demo.webp)

Ever found yourself endlessly scrolling through hairstyles and outfits, wondering "How would this look on me?" As someone who loves exploring different styles but hates the hassle, I dreamed of an app that could instantly show me wearing any look I fancy.

While AI technology has advanced tremendously, most AI face applications either require complex setup, demand high-end GPU hardware, or rely on cloud processing that compromises privacy.

**The ideal solution should be as simple as taking a selfie** - just drag, drop, and transform. No technical expertise needed, no expensive hardware required, and no privacy concerns.

So, why not build one myself?

And thatâ€™s how MagicMirror came to life âœ¨

Enjoy! ;)

## One More Thing

Every design element in MagicMirror - from the logo and typography to the UI - was created using AI âœ¨

I used [Tensor.ART](https://tusiart.com/), a free AI image generation platform. It offers access to the latest models like Flux and SD 3.5, plus the ability to train your own custom models. For example, I created MagicMirror's logo by training a Flux-based model on reference images collected from Dribbble - quick and simple.

Compared to platforms like [Civitai](https://civitai.com/) and [LibLib.AI](https://www.liblib.art/), [Tensor.ART](https://tusiart.com/) has more models at a lower price, making it the most cost-effective option. If you're looking to try AI image generation or want a more affordable platform, I recommend giving [Tensor.ART](https://tusiart.com/) a try.
