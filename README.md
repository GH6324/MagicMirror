## Motivation

![](demo.webp)

Ever found yourself endlessly scrolling through hairstyles and outfits, wondering "How would this look on me?" As someone who loves exploring different styles but hates the hassle, I dreamed of an app that could instantly show me wearing any look I fancy.

While AI technology has advanced tremendously, most AI face applications either require complex setup, demand high-end GPU hardware, or rely on cloud processing that compromises privacy.

**The ideal solution should be as simple as taking a selfie** - just drag, drop, and transform. No technical expertise needed, no expensive hardware required, and no privacy concerns.

So, why not build one myself?

And that’s how MagicMirror came to life ✨

Enjoy! ;)
